My project asks the data "What actually influences the wages paid to players?"

The inspirations behind this focus stems from my knowledge of NFL trends with
highly drafted prospects tending to receive high value contracts no matter
their performance, and vice versa with low draft picks/undrafted players, 
throughout their career. I have no knowledge of Fifa trends and wanted to see
if there was any similarity in through process in those who construct player
contracts.

In working through this project, I used Python with tools such as heatmap, 
OneHotEncoder, Normalizer, and other resources from the sklearn library.

I combed through the raw fifa data to extract the columns I thought may affect
contracts and converted each column to its appropriate data type while scaling 
them as necessary.

Ultimately, no clear conclusions were drawn which, in itself is a conclusion 
that the league(s) which contribute to FIFA do not function in the same 
pattern that the NFL does in American Football.
